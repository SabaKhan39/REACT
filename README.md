# Welcome to MyReactApp

This project is a simple React application demonstrating the creation of a basic component and running it in a development environment.

## Development Server

To start the development server, run `npm start` in your terminal. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser. The application will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

React allows you to quickly generate components using various tools like Create React App or manually. To create a new component manually, follow this structure:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run `npm run build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory. This command is useful when you're ready to deploy your application to a server.

## Running Tests

React applications can be tested using various testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library. To run tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```
